I'm OmegaVoid. I'm a scientist, a farmer and an infosec enthusiast.
I plant things by day, hack things by night.

I'm all about ethical hacking. Currently studying to take the OSCP exam. Hopefully we'll have that soon.

If you're looking to contact me, I can usually be found on the [TryHackMe](https://discord.com/invite/tryhackme) discord where I spend my days being a Community Mentor.

And remember, Hacking is not a Crime. Don't be a criminal.
