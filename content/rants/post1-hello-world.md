Summary: This is the mandatory "hello world" post that any creator must go through. Also something interesting coming soon. 

This is the mandatory "hello world" post that any creator must go through. Welcome to my first blog.

Let's figure this out and make it work. 

We've got some pretty interesting stuff coming up soon. Keep an eye out because we'll have a tutorial up on Saturday March 6th.

We'll have a talk about Stack Buffer Overflows on the [TryHackMe discord](https://discord.com/invite/tryhackme).
Hopefully we'll help some people who are a bit more reticent about trying Buffer Overflows to just smash through them and get them done.

Tune in on Saturday for an update.
