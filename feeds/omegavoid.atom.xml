&lt;p&gt;Let's figure this out and make it work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got some pretty interesting stuff coming up soon. Keep an eye out because we'll have a tutorial up on Saturday March 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have a talk about Stack Buffer Overflows on the &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/tryhackme"&gt;TryHackMe discord&lt;/a&gt;.
Hopefully we'll help some people who are a bit more reticent about trying Buffer Overflows to just smash through them and get them done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tune in on Saturday for an update.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Rants"></category><category term="rants"></category></entry></feed>
