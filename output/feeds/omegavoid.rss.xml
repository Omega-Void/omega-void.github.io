Welcome to my first blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's figure this out and make it work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got some pretty interesting stuff coming up soon. Keep an eye out because we'll have a tutorial up on Saturday March 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have a talk about Stack Buffer Overflows on the &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/tryhackme"&gt;TryHackMe discord&lt;/a&gt;.
Hopefully we'll help some people who are a bit more reticent about trying Buffer Overflows to just smash through them and get them done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tune in on Saturday for an update.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">OmegaVoid</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2021 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:omega-void.github.io,2021-03-05:/hello-world.html</guid><category>Rants</category><category>rants</category></item></channel></rss>
